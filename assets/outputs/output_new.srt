00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
I would say that in the next five years, if you aren't deep diving in being something

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,920
more, then a re-excript kitty.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,640
If you aren't understanding your terminal, understanding them, becoming the best you

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:13,960
can be, becoming the person that can do stuff that's really deep and difficult, I would

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:14,960
say that.

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,440
Yeah, you're probably going to be obsolete pretty quickly.

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,440
We'd say that.

8
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,960
Yeah, you're probably going to be obsolete pretty.

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,960
Okay.

10
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,440
Next 10 years?

11
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,440
Yeah.

12
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,960
Well, but if you're the one that can figure stuff out and you go deep, you're going

13
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,280
to be the one that's not obsolete.

14
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,280
You should figure out how to become an amazing programmer.

15
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,400
You should at some point tweet.
